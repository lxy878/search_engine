# Search Engine

Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JS and Nodejs: express, ejs, mysql2, sequelize and ....

This website is a google-like search engine. The front-end framework is followed by the design principle of KISS and it is developed by using HTML, CSS, and ejs.  The back-end framework is developed for the navigation of handling client-side requests and server-side responses. One main feature is allowing users to enter a string and then showing a list of results. Another feature is allowing admin to scrap details from websites to the local database.

Note: This website is only tested on the local host and it requires mysql run in the system.
